"""Genuine-divergence manifest — the machine-checked contract for absorb merges.

Each entry pins one deliberate Seraphiel divergence from upstream Hermes so a
clean-but-wrong merge (upstream relocating code and the merge silently dropping
our change) can never reach READY. Checked against any TREE OID via git
plumbing — no checkout. Update this manifest ONLY when the operator
deliberately moves or retires a divergence; never weaken it to make a merge
pass (that is the exact failure mode it exists to catch).
