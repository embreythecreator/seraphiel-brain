"""Parity report for an absorb merge.

Classifies the merged tree against full rebranded upstream (THEIRS) and the prior
HEAD, so the operator can see exactly what full parity pulled in, what genuine
divergence was preserved, and whether anything still needs a human:

  re-added      files present in merged & not in prior HEAD (un-trimmed / new)
  divergence    files where merged differs from THEIRS (our genuine changes)
  CONFLICTS     blobs still carrying <<<<<<< markers  -> MUST be zero to commit
  STRAY         hermes/nousresearch tokens outside legal carve-outs -> MUST be 0

Usage: parity_report.py <merged-tree> <theirs-tree> <head-ref>

# Legal carve-outs keep upstream attribution; UPSTREAM_BASE.md references upstream
# by name on purpose; the absorb harness itself defines the tokens it rewrites
# (both its legacy script home and its packaged home). The harness's own docs,
# skill, and tests name the upstream deliberately — carve them out by exact
# path (or narrow prefix), never by broad directory: a wide entry would mask
# real branding leaks. New absorb docs that trip the gate get added here
# consciously, one line each.
